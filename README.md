# beeswithfrickinlaserbeams
This repo is a demonstration of what can be achieved with CloudFormation and CFNDSL when using multiple AWS Services, in particular Lambda, AutoScaling, Javascript SDK and SSM.

I wrote it to be a substitute for bees with machine guns without the SSH.

It is defnitiely to be used in a production situation!

No warranty of any sort provided :D
